What is Hayoo?
-------------

Hayoo is a search engine for [Hackage][hackage] packages, which allows you to search for functions, data types and packages. Each indexed document consists of a name, a description and, if applicable, a signature. Have a look at the [examples](/Examples.md) on how to use Hayoo. In constrast to [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/), all available packages are indexed, but the signature search is not as advanced.

Hunt
----

Hayoo uses [Hunt][huntsearch] for indexing and searching. Hunt is a flexible, lightweight search platform with a powerful query language and JSON API. Hayoo exposes the query language through its own interface and allows the execution of advanced queries. 

Additionally, Hunt consists of a standalone web server for easy integration into existing infrastructures without having to write Haskell code.


JSON API
--------

Hayoo exposes a JSON API for other clients via [/json](/json?query=Monad). The [page](/json?query=Monad&page=2) parameter can be used to cycle through the pages.

Feedback
--------

Any feedback is greatly appreciated! You can contact us via e-mail ([hayoo2@fh-wedel.de](mailto:hayoo2@fh-wedel.de)) or use the [issue system][hayoo-issues] to report bugs or suggest features.  

History
-------

The old Hayoo! was based on the [Holumbus search engine][holumbus-github], which was developed in 2008-2009 by [Timo B. Kranz](//github.com/tbk303) and [Sebastian M. Gauck](https://twitter.com/sgauck).

The new Hayoo is a rewrite on top of the Hunt search engine, the successor of Holumbus, which was started in 2013 by [Ulf Sauer](//github.com/ulfS) and [Chris Reumann](//github.com/chrisreu) to improve and extend the
existing Holumbus framework. 

Both projects were developed at the [FH Wedel](http://fh-wedel.de) under supervision and active support of
[Prof. Dr. Uwe Schmidt](http://fh-wedel.de/~si).
